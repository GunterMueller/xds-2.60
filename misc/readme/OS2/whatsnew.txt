        module or an Oberon-2 main module (option MAIN is on)

        The SYSTEM.REF procedure was added (the same as ADR, but returns
        typized pointer.

        Compatibility rules for foreign procedures are relaxed further
        (see User's Guide->Multilanluage Programming->Relaxation of
        compatibility rules).

        Much more efficient (but still not ideal) code is generated
        for aggregate constants.

        Equations and environment variables may be used in redirections:
        *.sym = $(XDSDIR)/sym

        Separate exception source for ASSERT added

        Compiler sets new equations:
                MODULE (name of the current module)
                FILE (name of the current file)

        Compiler exit code is now either 0 (ok) or 1 (error).

        Files are opened using redirections and lookups if typed without
        path

        IDE maintains a list of source files which are either specified
        by user or received from the compiler.

        Project file editor:
                a number of bug fixes
                user options/equations

        arrays according to an API call semantics.

        Some negative constants replaced with large positive

Doc:

        ISO Modula-2 Library Reference added

        ISO Modula-2 Lexis and Syntax added

        RegComp.Substitute description is corrected

Version 2.10
------------

This is the first product version of Native XDS for OS/2. After more
then half a year of extensive testing we are happy to announce this
product.

For the users of XDS v2.06 we list the differences between v2.06
and v2.10. Note: there are no product versions such as v2.07,
v2.08, v2.09. The version v2.07 was used internally and
distributed as beta and demo version.

What is new in v2.10:

        1) Extended syntax of conditional expressions, e.g:

           <* IF defined cc & (cc = Watcom) THEN *>

           See "Configuring XDS" and "Conditional compilation".

        2) Relaxed compatibility rules are introduced for
           parameters of "C" procedures. See "Multilanguage
           programming".

        3) String literal may be used in a direct language
           specification instead of numeric values:
              "Oberon"  = 0
              "Modula"  = 1
              "C"       = 2
              "Pascal"  = 5
              "StdCall" = 7 (Win32 standard calling convention)
              "SysCall" = 8 (OS/2 system calls)

        4) new equations
              COMPILERHEAP   - defines compiler heap limit
              COMPILERTHRES  - defines compiler threshold

        5) New clause in the ERRFMT equation - errno (error
        number).

        6) new option M2UNPACKTYPES - for Windows interface

        7) new ALIGNMENET option

        8) equation declaration syntax is introduced:
           -xxx!value

        9) Make does not use dependency on a project file.


       10) New directives may be used in configuration, redirection
           project and template files:

           !if expr then
           !elsif expr then
           !else
           !end

           !message expr

           expr = simple [ ("=" | "#" | "<" | ">") simple ]
           simple = term { "+" | "OR" term }
           term = factor { "AND" factor }
           factor = "(" expr ")"| quoted_string
                  | "NOT" factor | "DEFINED" ident | ident
           ident = option | equation

       11) In all system files:

            \ at the end of line - line continuation.

            $! - denotes the directory name of this file:
               *.sym = $!/sym;

       12) new template syntax (See "Template files").
