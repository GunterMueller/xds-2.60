                   XDS Environment for OS/2
                   ------------------------
                            v2.21

1. Setting up the IDE profile path
----------------------------------

XDS Environment stores its configuration information in profiles.
These profiles may reside on any of your local and network drives.
Before you start using the Environment, you have to set up a profile
path, even if your installation is stand-alone.

In case of network installation, you may store the profiles either:

  - on local drives, to have unique profiles on each workstation.
  - on users' network directories mapped to the same drive letter,
    to have unique profiles for each user on all workstation.

To specify a directory for profiles, type:

    xds /i <directory>

at the OS/2 command prompt and press Enter.

If you do not set the profile path or the Environment fails to 
find the corresponding record in OS2.INI during startup, a directory
selection dialog box will be displayed.


2. How to start
---------------

To invoke the Environment, double click the XDS Environment icon 
in the XDS folder, or type 

    start /f xds

at the OS/2 command prompt and press Enter.
