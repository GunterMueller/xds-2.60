                 Using X Window and Motif APIs


This document contains a short description of the X11 and Motif 
APIs usage in your Modula-2/Oberon-2 programs.

1. Documentation

Your XDS package includes the X11/Motif API definition modules 
and support files, but no documentation on these APIs. You have
to use third-party books or the on-line documentation.
We regret the inconvenience.


2. Using the X11/Motif APIs in your programs

X11 and Motif definition modules reside in the `def/X11' and
`def/Xm' subdirectories of your XDS installation, resspectively. 
Use the `apisyms' script in the root of your XDS installation to
create symbol files for these APIs.

If your program is an X11 application, toggle the XAPP option
ON in the project file or on the command line:

    +XAPP

If your program is a Motif application, toggle the XMAPP option
ON in the project file or on the command line:

    +XMAPP

Note: These options are only used to set up additional include 
paths and libraries during processing of the template file, 
`bin/xm.tem'. That file contains defaults for Solaris, HP-UX,
and Linux. If the X11/Motif include files and libraries reside
in different directories on your target system, you have to edit
the default template file or to use your own modified copy in your 
projects.


3. Declaring callbacks

You have to specify the "C" calling and naming convention for
your callback procedures:

PROCEDURE ["C"] QuitCB (
                    w: Xt.Widget;
                    client_data: Xt.XtPointer;
                    call_data: Xt.XtPointer);

                     [end of document]
