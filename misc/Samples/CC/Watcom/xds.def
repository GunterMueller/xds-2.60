   Interface to XDS run-rime system can be changed at any moment.
------------------------------------------------------------------
  This module defines an interface to XDS run-time initialization.

  XDS_Init must be called from main() before you'll call any
           Modula/Oberon code,
  XDS_Exit will terminate an application,
  Call XDS_Init_History just after XDS_Init if you'll need a
           "execution history" feature of XDS
