                         XDS-C OS/2 Edition
                         ------------------
                               v2.50

                           Read Me First!


In  the  following text we assume that you have chosen the C:\XDS
directory for installation. If another directory was used, please
use the name of that directory instead.

1. Directory structure
----------------------

The following directory structure is created during installation:

C:\XDS\
    BIN             executable and system files
    C               XDS-C library C source 
    DEF\            library definition modules:
        ISO             ISO Modula-2 library
        OB2             Oberon-2 libraries pseudo-definition modules
        OS2             OS/2 API
        PIM             PIM library
        POSIX           POSIX interface
        XDS             XDS library
    DOC             on-line documentation
    INCLUDE         XDS-C library include files
    LIB\
        C           XDS-C libraries
    README          text files with important information
    SAMPLES         Modula-2/Oberon-2 code samples
    SETUP           Setup programs and data
    SYM\
        C           XDS-C symbol files


2. Expanding and shrinking file names
-------------------------------------

Names of symbol files and files containing definition modules are
initially FAT-compatible (limited to 8.3). If you have installed
the XDS package onto a file system that supports long file names
(e.g. HPFS), you may wish to expand those file names. To do this,
double click the "Expand/Shrink File Names" icon in the XDS folder.
You may revert back to short file names any time later by clickng
that icon again.

If you prefer command line, go to the directory C:\XDS\SETUP and
invoke

    fatfs -        to expand filenames
    fatfs +        to shrink file names

NOTE: Whenever you install an additional XDS product or maintain
      your existing installation, file names are shrinked back
      to 8.3 automatically, to ensure correct processing. 


3. Creating a Working Directory
---------------------------------

To start working on a new project, create a new directory, make it
current and invoke the XMWORK script to create the redirection
file and the appropriate subdirectories:

    c:
    mkdir \WORK
    cd \WORK
    xmwork


4. How to start
---------------

To start the compiler, type

    xm {options | modes} module_or_project_file {options | modes}

at the OS/2 command prompt and press Enter. Specifying no arguments
will cause a brief help to be printed.
