1. Add "reset path" button to the Load dialog
2. Is it possible to have the pop-up menu remain on the screen
   when the mouse button is released? If not, we have to add "Help" to it.
3. Advanced dialog: make a diff. between WM_BTN2DOWN and WM_BTN2CLICK -
   the latter is to display a pop-up menu.
4. New WP dialog: It is possible to edit mirror file name even if the
   field looks disabled.
5. Winbar: Move to 4 group does not work
6. Color dialog: it is non standard and incorrectly displayed in
   256 color mode. Use standard dialog instead.
7. The toolbar button dialog looks empty. Design more buttons.
8. The Help button in the Edit colors dialog invokes a wrong help page.
9. EdGoto(,0) -> crash and wrong entry in macro table.
10. Move focus away from the key entry field after the key is entered,
    as if the Tab key was pressed.
11. Make Variable lists directly accessible from menu.
12. Simplify regex's in filters, as Pasha did.
13. Correct regexs in both XDS lib and IDE.
14. Design and implement initialization mechanisms for variable lists,
    associations, workplace templates, etc. Should this be entirely
    accessible from REXX?
15. Change version to 2.31 and copyright to 1996-98 XDS Ltd.
16. Execute() should allow to control modality of the pop-up window.
17. Intercept REXX SAY and the like.
18. Disable "Recall macro editor" when appropriate.
